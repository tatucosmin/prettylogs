# prettylogs

A simple logging library in Go. Pretty logs currently is supporting the following features, with some of them planned for the future:

- [x] Logging different log levels (e.g. Debug, Warning, Error, etc.)
- [x] Support for any io.Writer
- [x] Ability to disable prefixes (e.g. `[DEBUG]`, `[INFO]`, etc.)
- [x] Add timestamps option
- [ ] Add flag to enable colorful output to os.Stdout
- [ ] Add structured logging support with JSON

# ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```
go get github.com/tatucosmin/prettylogs
```

# üî® Example

```go
package main

import (
	plogs "github.com/tatucosmin/prettylogs"
)

func main() {
	logger := plogs.New()
	/*
		New will intialize with this data as default
		- os.Stdout as the io.Writer
		- LogInfoLevel which will only print logs with level >= LogInfoLevel
		- prefixes (e.g. [DEBUG], [INFO], etc) enabled
		- timestamps enabled
		note: if you need more granular Logger initialization use the NewConfigurable function
	*/

	logger.Warn("this is a warn log\n")
	// prints "[WARN] this is a warn log" without changing the default level

	logger.Log("this is an info log\n")
	// prints "[INFO] this an info log" as by default the logger has the LogInfoLevel set

	logger.LogWithLevel(plogs.LogDebugLevel, "this message will NOT print\n")
	logger.SetLoggerLevel(plogs.LogDebugLevel)
	logger.LogWithLevel(plogs.LogDebugLevel, "this message will print\n")

	/*
		final output:
		2025-01-19 15:22:31 [WARN] this is a warn log
		2025-01-19 15:22:31 [INFO] this is an info log
		2025-01-19 15:22:31 [DEBUG] this message will print
	*/
}
```

# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why?

I wanted to practice my Go-lang skills and was finding myself in the situation where this was all around my code which I found confusing:

```go
fmt.Printf("debug value: %v\n")
```

To simplify this, I created a library that provides a cleaner and more structured way to debug values with minimal boilerplate.
